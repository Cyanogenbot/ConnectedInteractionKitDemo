# How-To run digital plane
The digital twin of the Connected Interaction Kit is hosted on Data-Foundry but can also be ran locally, opening the HTML file is enough! If you want to host the HTML file on datafoundry here are the following steps:
1. Create a new Data Foundry project.
2. Create a new `existing` type dataset.
3. Inside the existing dataset upload the planeviz.html file
4. On the dataset page open the `Web-Access` tab in this menu select the `planeviz.html` file as entrypoint and publish the site by pressing the `ACTIVATE WEB ACCESS` button
5. Open the link, the vizualisation should now be showing!
